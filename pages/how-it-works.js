                If you earn money online, it means you likely have tasks to
                complete - and you probably wouldn&apos;t mind some pocket money
                to fund your business! This is where the lottery comes in. It
                aims to help with 2 common issues that plague women with online
                businesses - <strong>productivity and funding</strong>. Our
                founder, Hayley, has travelled to many countries and came across
                many women who were trying to make a living online. And so
                Online CoWork was born. (But let&apos;s not forget that this is
                also about having a bit of fun and connecting with like-minded
                people from around the world!)

                  If this is your first time participating, you will please need
                  to register for the lottery by creating a profile.{" "}
                </strong>{" "}
                You can access the profile form by clicking the &apos;Start
                Here&apos; button at the top of the page (Note: Your wallet
                needs to be connected in order to see this button).

                bring more clients/sales to your business - or followers to your

                2) To add your first business task that you&apos;ve been
                procrastinating about completing, make sure that{" "}
                <strong>you have a free crypto wallet</strong> and that it{" "}

                <strong>Type your task into the box</strong>. You will also need
                to add an amount in MATIC that you believe would personally give

                NOTE:
                <br />
                a) Each tasks costs a minimum of 1 MATIC.
                <br />
                b) For every 1 MATIC that you put into the lottery prize pool
                each week, you get one entry! That means, if you bet $100 on
                yourself that you will say create your SEO strategy by the end
                of the week, that means your name will go into the hat 100 times
                for that particular lottery draw!
                <br />
                c) You will NOT be getting this money back. This money will be
                added to the lottery prize pool that the lottery winner (yes,
                that could be you!) will win each week.

                <br />
                <br />
                4) When you push the button, your wallet will pop up and
                you&apos;ll be asked to <strong>confirm the transaction</strong>
                . To add a transaction on the blockchain, you will also need to
                pay a tiny &apos;gas fee&apos; which is usually less than
                $0.01c. This will be calculated automatically when you make your
                transaction. Please keep in mind that the gas fee can change and
                we have no control over this as it is a fee required for the
                Polygon Network and has nothing to do with Online CoWork.
                <br />
                <br />
                5) Once the transaction has been confirmed,{" "}
                <strong>
                  you should see it appear in the task feed below the form
                </strong>
                . Now go, go go - <strong>get your task done!</strong>{" "}
                You&apos;ll be able to see the tasks of others appearing in the
                task feed as well, and this will also hopefully help to motivate
                you to get working!
                <br />
                <br />
                6) The 1 MATIC that each person pays for each task gets{" "}
                <strong>
                  pooled together to create the lottery &quot;winnings&quot;
                </strong>
                . These winnings will be distributed to one random &quot;Online
                CoWorker&quot; every 7 days to provide funding for their online
                business - to pay for things such as website hosting, shopify
                fees, extra product stock, etc. Or alternatively, if the Online
                CoWorker doesn&apos;t have an online business, it could be used
                to pay for educational courses for professional/personal
                development - but it&apos;s up to you! The money is yours to use
                for anything that would help you to move forwards in your life.
                <br />
                <br />
                8) The lottery prize will be reset each week.
                <br />
                <br />
                9) We will decide how many winners there are per week. Usually
                it will be 1 to 3 winners per week. if you win, please note that
                you won&apos;t be able to win for the next draw so as to allow
                others to win as well. You may still participate in the lottery
                for accountability for your tasks and to support other women in
                business, but your wallet address will be hidden for 1 week.

                verification), so it&apos;s great for getting started quickly to
                create your lottery profile. But while you can buy MATIC
                directly in this wallet, you cannot withdraw your winnings to
                your bank account. You would still need to transfer your

                is a great tutorial on how to set up Metamask step-by-step.
                <br />
                <br />
                ** Something important to note about a Metamask and Coinbase
                wallet though is that they is not like a bank that you can call
                if you have a problem. You are{" "}
                <strong>FULLY in charge of the account</strong>. When you create
                your wallet, you will be given a <strong>secret phrase</strong>.
                This secret phrase is like the pin number for your bank account.
                However, if you lose the secret phrase, you will lose access to
                any funds in your Metamask forever. Wallet security is extremely
                important in the blockchain world, so it is important to keep
                your secret phrase safe! Write it on paper, put it in a ziploc
                bag and put it in a safe place - or even put it in a few safe
                places. This secret phrase can be used by anyone to access your
                account - so make sure it is in a place where no-one can use it
                and never share it with anyone online.

                Unfortunately, it is impossible for us to know if you actually
                completed your task or not. If all users &quot;complete&quot;

                which gives some options! You can then convert your earnings
                into MATIC to use for the lottery! Remember, you only need to
                add one task (around 1 USD) to be eligible for the draw that
                week!

                Another option is to sign up for a Coinbase wallet with a

                - as you may get $10 in Bitcoin for signing up! You can then

                wallet address to use for the lottery!

                Unfortunately, you cannot withdraw to your bank account or
                Paypal directly from Metamask. You would need to send your
                crypto from your Metamask to your Coinbase wallet and request
                withdrawal from there to your bank account or Paypal.

                However, if you are using ZenGo/Coinbase to connect directly to
                Online CoWork, then you can just request withdrawal directly in
                your ZenGo/Coinbase app. If you have any struggles - ZenGo and
                Coinbase have extensive help center where you can chat with them
                for advice. There are also many videos on YouTube on withdrawing
                from these platforms.

                Note: Your wallet may charge you a withdrawal fee or 1 to 3% -
                please check with your wallet provider.
